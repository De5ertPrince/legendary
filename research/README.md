This directory is for organizing research materials and notes. 
For example, you may want to document the resources you used to figure out how to wire the camera, take photos, 
run machine learning models, and send messages. You may want to organize these in different files or, possibly, in
different directories, in the event that the research is more complex than a single file can convey. This might be the
case for the machine learning models which will probably require multiple configuration files and/or model weights.
