During the Engineering Design Process, designers frequently jump back and forth between steps. Going back to earlier steps is common. This way of working is called “iteration,” and it is likely that your process will do the same!
Remember: While engineers create new things — such as products, websites, environments and experiences — scientists study how nature works. If your project involves making observations and doing experiments, your project might better fit the Scientific Method.
